# About me

My name is Charly, I am a computer science enthusiast who loves to learn and play with new technologies. Being passionate about programming since high school I got my Master of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence in 2022.
Despite my training being in AI and Data science, my principal interests are in game development, embedded system, computer graphics and cybersecurity.

On this website you'll find all my personal projects.
